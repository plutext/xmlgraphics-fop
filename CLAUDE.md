# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`docx4j-fo-renderer`: an upstream-tracking fork of Apache FOP 2.11, maintained for
docx4j's docx-to-PDF path. The Java packages stay `org.apache.fop`; the Maven
coordinates are `org.docx4j:docx4j-fo-renderer[-core|-events|-util]`, versions
`2.11-docx4j.N`. `README.md` is the authoritative description: the coordinates, the
table of changes from Apache FOP 2.11 with their upstream status, and the hooks with
their `Docx4jFop` capability names. Keep that README current; it is what docx4j's
`FopCapabilities` probe and a consumer's support question rely on.

The design is docx4j's CR-020, `../docx4j/docs/developer/change-requests/CR-020-fo-renderer-fork.md`:
§2 the decisions (fork, tracking upstream; a distinct identity with no Apache mark in
the product name; packages kept; graceful degradation), §3 the design, §4 the phases,
§8 progress, §9 the classification of the Metanorma and Chunlin commits. That CR stays
in docx4j; this repository holds the code, and any fork-side CR of its own under
`docs/developer/change-requests/` (none yet).

## Branches and remotes

- `docx4j-2.11` is the fork's branch (from the `fop-2_11` tag; 206 commits over
  `trunk` at 2026-09-18, most of them the coordinate and notice changes plus the
  phase 1 hooks). Work on it; release from it.
- `trunk` tracks Apache's `main`. Remotes: `origin` = plutext/xmlgraphics-fop,
  `upstream` = apache/xmlgraphics-fop, `metanorma` and `chunlin` = the two forks whose
  commits CR-020 §9 classified.
- `FOP-3328`, `FOP-3328-on-trunk`, `FOP-cjk-radical-tounicode`,
  `FOP-empty-glyph-not-composite`, `FOP-packed-glyph-bboxes` are the upstream-facing
  branches: one fix each, cut against `trunk`, for a JIRA and a PR on Apache's GitHub.
- An upstream-bound fix is done twice: on its own `FOP-####` branch against `trunk`
  for the PR, and on `docx4j-2.11` for the fork. A docx4j-only hook goes on
  `docx4j-2.11` only.
- Merge `upstream/main` into `docx4j-2.11` at least at every Apache release and
  whenever a fix sent from here lands upstream.

## Build and test commands

Apache FOP's own Maven build, Java 8 and later (Java 11 or 21 here):

```bash
mvn -B package checkstyle:check spotbugs:check     # what CI runs on every push (.github/workflows/maven.yml)
mvn install -DskipTests                            # the snapshot docx4j consumes (2.11-docx4j.1-SNAPSHOT)
mvn -pl fop-core test -Dtest=SomeTestCase           # one test class
mvn -pl fop-core test -Dtest=LayoutEngineTestSuite  # FOP's layout tests (fop-core/test/layoutengine/standard-testcases) - slow
```

`fop-sandbox`, `fop-servlet` and the transcoders are in the tree but not built.
Every modified file carries a change notice under its licence header (the form in the
existing ones); checkstyle enforces FOP's style, so run it before offering a commit.
`LineBreakUtils` is generated from Unicode data by
`fop-core/src/main/codegen/unicode/java/.../GenerateLineBreakUtils.java`; the `pair-table`
hook must be re-added after any regeneration.

## The split with the docx4j session

This repository has its own Claude session; docx4j has another (`ListAgents` shows it
as `docx4j-<n>`). Messages go between them with `SendMessage`.

| this session owns | the docx4j session keeps |
|---|---|
| the cherry-picks (CR-020 §8, P2-1 to P2-8), one branch each, FOP's own tests green | which items go to the fork, and in what order (Jason decides; the CR records it) |
| the phase 3 structural items in the layout engine | the consumer side: `docx4j-export-fo`'s `FopCapabilities`, the gating of each rule on a hook, the `-Pfo-renderer-fork` profile |
| upstream tracking, JIRA text drafted for Jason to file, PRs titled `FOP-####: ...` | the fidelity gate: `docx4j-export-fo` tests, then the corpus scored against Word (Enterprise CR-001, run from `../Plutext-Enterprise-Java-11`) |
| the first release `2.11-docx4j.1` to Maven Central (signed, sources, javadoc; the `org.docx4j` credentials) | Enterprise CR-001 §6.6 (the running list of FOP limitations, with the docx4j-side workaround per item) and CR-020 itself |

The gate lives in docx4j because only the Word-scored corpus says whether a FOP change
helped. So one round trip per item:

1. Cherry-pick or write the change on its branch; change notice; README table row (and
   the hooks table if it adds a capability, with the `Docx4jFop` constant); FOP's tests
   and checkstyle green.
2. Before `mvn install`, ask the docx4j session whether a gate is running: a snapshot
   install replaces the jars under `~/.m2` that its running gate is reading (this has
   bitten before). Install only on its word, or when it is idle.
3. Message it: branch, commit, what changed in one paragraph, the §6.6 item or JIRA it
   serves, and what a pass would look like. It runs the gate and replies pass or fail with
   the measurement; a fail comes back with the scoreboard reading, not a guess.
4. On a pass, merge to `docx4j-2.11`; it records the item in CR-020 §8 and, where the
   change closes a §6.6 item, tells the Enterprise session. On a fail, the change stays
   on its branch.

Never run a Maven build inside `../docx4j` or `../Plutext-Enterprise-Java-11` from here:
each has one session, and a concurrent build races their `target/classes`.

## Hazards

- **The fork and Apache FOP must never both be on one classpath**: same packages, so
  classpath order decides which wins. docx4j warns when it sees both; do not create the
  situation in a test here either.
- **No Apache mark in the product name**, and the README's "modified distribution"
  notice stays: CR-020 §2.2. Apache FOP is a trademark of the Apache Software Foundation.
- A hook is a public accessor or one setter that changes nothing FOP does on its own
  (README, "Hooks"). If a change alters FOP's behaviour it is a fix, and goes upstream
  first unless it is docx4j-specific.
- `docx4j-export-fo` subclasses 2.11 internals; a change to a layout manager's shape
  breaks docx4j's layout managers. Tell the docx4j session before changing a signature
  its managers use (the `inline-access` members are the list).

## Registry

`../docx4j-portfolio/tasks.yaml` indexes the change requests across the docx4j
repositories; this repository's key is `fop`. CR-020 and its phases are registered as
`docx4j/CR-020.*` because the CR lives in docx4j; a fork-side CR would be `fop/CR-001`
with its doc here. When a phase's status changes, tell the docx4j session (it edits the
docx4j CR's Status line), or, for a fork-side CR, edit the entry and run
`python3 ../docx4j-portfolio/scripts/tasks.py check` then `accept`.

## AI attribution in commits

- Stamp your own session's model (`Co-Authored-By: Claude <model>`, per the harness
  default). Never copy the model name from trailers in git history.
- If another model materially contributed in this session, add a second
  `Co-Authored-By` line for it.
- New files carry the licence header Apache's files carry (the change-notice form for a
  modified Apache file; this is an Apache-2.0 derivative, not a Plutext original).

## Start here

CR-020 phase 2's classification report is done and eight cherry-picks are queued, P2-1
to P2-8, listed with their sources in CR-020 §8 "Phase 2". Jason reads the report before
any of them starts; do not begin P2-1 until he says so. The release
(`docx4j/CR-020.release`) waits on phase 2. Upstream: FOP-3328 and FOP-3330 are filed
with PRs 106 and 107 open; the `glyf-empty-glyph` and CJK-radical fixes have JIRA text
drafted (see the README table) and wait on Jason filing them.
